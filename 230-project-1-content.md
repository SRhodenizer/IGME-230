Sound will be ambient noise, some background music and zombie noises so it does not seem to silent. There will also be sounds for item interactions, and button presses.

##Gameplay
The player will play the game with only the mouse. Using the cursor and left mouse button to find and uses items to solve puzzles. It will use a first person view and use room based rpg elements. There will be a countdown and if the player does not escape during the given time they will be eaten by the zombies.

The player is initially taught the game just by playing through. Getting the story's premise and controls explained through a title sequence and then thrown into the beginning of the game.
To beat the game the player will need to learn how to complete all the puzzles within the given time limit or their brains shall be devoured.
